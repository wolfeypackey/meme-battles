- [ ] Create 3-5 more battles
- [ ] Test ledger export endpoint
- [ ] Generate a test meme

### Within 24 Hours
- [ ] Monitor Vercel function logs
- [ ] Check Neon database queries
- [ ] Verify battles are settling automatically
- [ ] Test rate limiting

## 🎯 Success Metrics to Track

**Day 1**:
- Unique wallet connections
- Total predictions
- Battles settled

**Week 1**:
- Daily active users
- Retention rate

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Database Connection Error
**Problem**: "Cannot connect to database"
**Solution**: Check DATABASE_URL in Vercel, ensure Neon project is active

### Wallet Won't Connect
**Problem**: Wallet button doesn't work
**Solution**: Update NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL to match actual Vercel domain

### Cron Not Running
**Problem**: Battles not settling
**Solution**: Check Vercel Settings → Crons, verify CRON_SECRET is set

### Rate Limit Errors
**Problem**: Getting 429 errors
**Solution**: This is normal during testing, wait 1-5 minutes
